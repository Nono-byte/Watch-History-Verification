# Watch-History-Verification

The client has expressed a requirement to ensure that the learning device restricts students from performing multiple tasks simultaneously. The client wants to verify whether the system enforces this restriction effectively to maintain a seamless learning experience for the students.

The problem at hand is to assess the learning platform's functionality and confirm that it prevents students from engaging in more than one task concurrently. This restriction is crucial to ensure that students can focus on a single task at a time, preventing distractions and promoting efficient learning.

The client expects the following outcomes from the verification process:

- Identify any instances where students are able to perform multiple tasks simultaneously on the learning platform.
- Evaluate the system's behavior when students attempt to switch between tasks and confirm that it enforces the restriction effectively.
- Assess the responsiveness and reliability of the system in enforcing the task restriction across various user scenarios.
- Provide actionable recommendations to address any identified gaps or issues in the system's ability to restrict students to one task at a time.
- Ensure that the learning platform delivers a seamless and distraction-free learning experience for students, allowing them to focus on their educational tasks effectively.
